# I-O-Hack-Program
This code won first place in I/O Labs Hack for Humanity Hackaton. It was meant to be a search program for irrigation based on a map of boolean values. It has 3 conditions (isolated, dry, wet), and the code automatically irrigated the map in a way that every single cell would be irrigated or neighbours with a wet cell.
